Or perhaps you are trying to find a cure for snoring, tiredness or excessive sleepiness during the day?\\r\\n \\r\\nSleep apnea is a serious disorder in which your breathing repeatedly stops and starts while you sleep. Over 25 million Americans have it, but 80% still remain undiagnosed. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is Ognomy?\\r\\n\\r\\nOgnomy is the only end-to end care platform for sleep apnea, where patients meet doctors virtually, to get tested, diagnosed and treated for this terrible disease, all from the comfort of their homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho Is It For?\\r\\n\\r\\nOgnomy is for anybody who struggles with sleep apnea symptoms and needs to see a specialist but prefers the convenience, affordability, or privacy of telemedicine and virtual care. The goal of Ognomy is to safely and confidentiality help the patient to make knowledgeable, educated decisions concerning their own health, and put you on the right course of treatment and on-going care.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some instances, access to care may be limited by the availability of sleep specialists, geography, difficulty getting to see a physician or simply a preference not to have an in-office visit. Ognomy’s state-of-the-art telemedicine platform accommodates for these situations - allowing experts to guide patients through each stage of their sleep apnea care in the comfort of their own home or on the go. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does Ognomy work?\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Install the app.\\r\\n2) Give your information as if you’re meeting your doctor for the first time.\\r\\n3) Schedule a video consultation with one of our board-certified sleep medicine specialists.\\r\\n4) Through our innovative, online platform, patients schedule their virtual appointment with a board-certified sleep physician at a time that works for their schedule. Each physician is licensed in the patient’s state as required by state licensing laws. \\r\\n5) If found to be at risk for sleep apnea, patients will complete a home sleep apnea test in the comfort of their own bed and, once returned, schedule another telemedicine appointment with their physician to analyze the test results. \\r\\n6) If a positive diagnosis is returned, the patient will receive a prescription, personalized therapy equipment recommendations, be connected directly to a durable medical equipment supplier (to send your CPAP, BiPAP, or other treatment as required) and get on-going support to help acclimate to sleep therapy.\\r\\n7) Over the next few months you can track your treatment progress through the app and attend follow-up virtual consultations as we guide you on your journey to better sleep.\\r\\n \\r\\nBenefits of using Ognomy:\\r\\n \\r\\n- No commute: jump out of bed and be on time! Convenient appointments anywhere, anytime (weekends as well as weekdays). File your paperwork, take a sleep test, schedule your appointment, pay your copay, and video chat with your doctor from our HIPAA-compliant app, without ever leaving the house\\r\\n\\r\\n- Simple interface: Our interface is intuitive and easy to use and can be accessed using either a tablet or an Apple or Android mobile device. This offers better flexibility and reduces the time commitment of patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Lower cost: we accept most insurances but also Ognomy is self-pay, or you can pay through our monthly subscription model.

It can't be filled out electronically so you have to print it, then fill it out, the scan it or photograph it, then return it through the app. For me it would be much simpler to complete it on my PC and attach it to a reply email. OR, print it, fill it out, scan it, and attach it to a reply email. When an appointment is scheduled, Ognomy wants to handle the video call through the app. I HATE THIS. It's so much simpler for me to set up a video call on my laptop. The screen is larger, and the laptop sits on my desk. It's much more convenient than video chatting on my phone. My doctor has been able to accommodate my request, but I have to request that he set it up and send me a link.
